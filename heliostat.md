# Heliostat Development

## Structure


### 2 pvc pipes wrapped in the ends of a mylar sheet is our heliostat.

#### Problems
##### Diffuse Reflection

The reflection is kind of wonky. We want to test the stability of the reflection by mounting it shittily 
and measuring the deflection via 3 solar panels placed side to side and measuring the power output as a baseline and then
concentrating the heliostat on the central one and measuring the power output of the central one and checking whether the
wind-induced deflection actually throws it off onto adjacent panels...

###### TODO:
Get Three Solar Panels and a power meter
    
##### Wind
Fuck it we ride.

###### Frame Torque
Usual ting.

###### Surface Flutter
Electrostatic


##### Actuation
Gears. Talking to a 3d printing service in quetta.

### Inflatable tire with a glue
